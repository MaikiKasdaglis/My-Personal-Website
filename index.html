            Bio
        </h2>
        <section class="bio">
            As a software engineering student, I find joy in creative problem solving and take pride in creating complex structures that work together to achieve simple and elegant outcomes. I am comfortable working with Excel and am currently learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Although I have not worked on any software engineering projects, my experience as a restaurant manager has honed my skills in thinking on the fly and deploying creative solutions tailored to the unique needs of the day, staff, and landscape.

            As I continue to learn more about software engineering, I hope to focus my efforts in a career where I'm challenged technically and creatively. I am particularly interested in projects that help make people's daily lives easier, especially as it applies to navigating the US healthcare system. 
            
            What sets me apart from other software engineering students is my extensive experience in running high volume and upscale restaurants and cocktail bars. My people skills are top-notch, I am extremely organized, and I thrive in high-pressure environments. I am also a bit older than most software engineering students, which has given me a unique perspective and a wealth of experience that I can bring to the table.
